### to use:
* type string number directly followed by fret number, followed by a space, ex: `10 21 33 11, etc`
* type `space` as many times as desired to add spacing between notes.
* for chords type all 6 string number/fret number sets together.  ex: G major = `635240302313`
* for chords with fewer than 6 strings use `xx` for string/fret.  ex: D major = `xxxx40322312`
* type `99` for a barline.
* Experimental, more coming soon!

Example: `60 10 20 10 52 10 20 10 52 112 210 112 60 60 60`
